<h2 id="wrap-dat-api">Wrap dat API!</h2>
<p>The goal of this group project is to develop a R package wrapping a RESTful API.</p>
<p>You get to choose the API, and you are responsible for: the design and implementation of the package; the completeness and readibility of the documentations and of the vignettes; the test coverage of the code.</p>
<p>Bonus points are reserved for those project that decide to go public and open. Remember that to do that you DO NOT need a perfectly polished piece of software. You need a good idea, and that&#39;s pretty much the bare minimum. More about this in a moment.</p>
<p>You will work as a group, and I followed your suggestion to let you form the groups. However, this is not a democracy and you will have to report to me. To do that, I <strong>expect</strong> you to: (1) commit and push often (e.g., anytime you write some meaningful piece of code or documentation) and (2) keep a daily project notebook. I may not check every day, every person: I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Form a group on Canvas with max 3 people</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Set up a group repo where your package will live, and work on it through pull requests (forks or branches, your choices) and NOT through direct commits. You will have a link to that repo and your project notebook in your own repo.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Tell me what API you are going to work on, and what is, roughly speaking, your intended outcome. I may dissuade you from attempting something too ambitious (or in the really <em>rare</em> case that you are attempting something way too easy) but you are the boss. In general, projects fail because they are too ambitious, not because they are too easy.</p>

<p>The goal of the package is to wrap into a set of R functions a web REST API and offer a package for others to use those functions. The functions offered by the package should also take care of the minimum wrangling necessary to output the data in a viable format (that is, not as a raw binary file, unless a raw binary file is the most appropriate data format). You choose the API and the most appropriate input / output design of your functions. Think carefully of what part of the wrangling is of general interest (i.e., most or all of the users will want to perform it, and thus should be done in the package) and what part is only relevant as an example for the vignette (i.e., is too specific to be of general interest, and thus may just end up in the vignette.)</p>
<p>Copy/pasting from Lab2 (do what ever is essential), here are some ideas of APIs (just some almost random example):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/">Github Activity</a> a rather new API &quot;Serving up the &#39;social&#39; in Social Coding, the Activity APIs provide access to notifications, subscriptions, and timelines.&quot;.</li>
<li>all of thise <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/category/reference/api">references</a> APIs are (probably, I did not check ALL of them) good examples.</li>
<li><a href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-laws-api">BC laws</a> search through the laws in BC.</li>
<li><a href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?tags=API">BC data apis</a> a collection of APIs for BC data.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.gdeltproject.org/gdelt-geo-2-0-api-debuts/">GDELT</a> This is a rewarding, yet <strong>tough</strong>, one. Take a look at <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/json.html">leaflet</a> for an idea on how to use what you get back from GDELT. Also, Alex Bresler has started working on an <a href="https://github.com/abresler/gdeltr2">R wrapper</a> that may get you inspired.</li>
<li><a href="https://open.canada.ca/en/access-our-application-programming-interface-api">Canada open data</a> Another rewarding but tough one.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.quandl.com/docs/api">Quandl</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a>: you can get stats about open source projects and developers, and say something interesting about them</li>

</ul>
<p>The package must be installable in Windows, Mac and Linux environments. Rare ecceptions are possibile, but you will need to extensively document and prove that you can&#39;t reasonably have your package to compile.</p>
<p>The functions in the code must be tested and documented. I&#39;m talking not just forward facing documentation for the user, but also inline comments for developers to navigate your source code and understand it.</p>
<p>Read the <em>Best practices for API packages</em> <code>httr</code> <a href="http://httr.r-lib.org/articles/api-packages.html">vignette</a>. Do it. Read them. I do expect your package to apply to the best practices. Also, recall what you learnt in Collaborative Software Development module).</p>
<p>As a remainder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of this project, these packages should:</p>
<ul>
<li> [...] functions should handle errors gracefully</li>
<li> be well documented using all possible documentation tools</li>
<li>   have unit and integration tests</li>
<li>   use Travis for continuous integration (with a passing build stamp in the README)</li>
<li><pre><code>have a Software Licence that describes how you will permit others to use your work</code></pre>
</li>
<li><pre><code>have a code of conduct document that describes behavioural expectations of team interactions</code></pre>
</li>
<li><pre><code>have a contributions document that outlines how the team will work together (expected workflow practices)</code></pre>
</li>
<li>   have a Git history that demonstrates the proposed workflow in the CONTRIBUTING.md file was followed and that all group members contributed equally</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You may want to find an API for which no R wrapper already exists, or you find the existing one too cumbersome / too limiting.</p>
<h3 id="docs-and-vignettes">Docs and vignettes</h3>
<p>rubric={writing:30,mechanics:10,viz:10}</p>
<p>Special attention will be given to assess the completeness and readibility of your documentation and vignettes. Have at a least one vignette, illustrating most if not all of your package functionality. Documentation must be readable.</p>
<p>And <strong>hard</strong> requirement for the vignette is that the workflow you offer should include some plotting: show me how to go from zero to graph.</p>

<p><strong>THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL TASK.</strong><br>Document and report daily your job in your own github repo for the assignment. There are different technology / tools to do this, but the least is a Rmarkdown document, updatated daily, with a short summary of what you did that day for the project, its role in the bigger group picture, and links to the github commits proving your efforts. It is also important to document any relevant development decision you took (e.g., &quot;I decided to use this instead of that because this reason&quot;).  </p>
<p>This is an interesting reading about dry lab notebooks: <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385">http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004385</a><br>While this post illustrates how to keep one in <code>Bookdown</code> (not that yours needs to be that fancy): <a href="https://timoast.github.io/blog/2017-04-03-comp-notebook/">https://timoast.github.io/blog/2017-04-03-comp-notebook/</a> 
<strong>THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL TASK.</strong>  </p>
<p>P.S. A <em><strong>hypertough</strong></em> project (you should attempt this ONLY if you feel completely comfy and speedy in working with APIs and secrets and stuff) is to develop an R package that uses the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/">Github Activity</a> APIs, and some input from the user, to produce this Rmarkdown notebook we are speaking about.</p>
<h3 id="optional-go-public">(optional) Go public</h3>
<p>rubric={spark:10}</p>
<p>Go public and let other people use and contribute to your package. Good ideas to do this is submitting to <a href="https://ropensci.org/">ROpenSci</a> and/or submitting to CRAN.</p>
